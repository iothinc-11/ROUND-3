Salazar who managed to survive has returned to tortuga in search of vengeance. There he meets the now resurrected davy jones who
also wants to capture Jack. They both form an alliance as a part of which Davy jones decides to give salazar a clue.
Davy jones gives salazar 2 lists of numbers using which salazar has to find the 3rd list which would reveal the island name where Jack Sparrow is.
Davy jones tells salazar that  all the elements in the second list are distinct and is also present in the first list and asks salazar to sort 
the first array relative to the second array i.e Relative ordering of elements in the first list should be the same as in the second list.
The numbers that don't appear in the second list should be placed at the end of the first list in the non-decreasing order.
By following this procedure, Salazar will be able to produce the desired third list of numbers. Davy Jones further assures him that all the numbers in each
of the list is from 1 to 27 (Inclusive).

Eg:
List-1: 11,8,21,7,24,10,2,8,24,21,1,21,3
List-2: 2,21,3,8,7

List-3: 2,21,21,21,3,8,8,7,1,10,11,24,24

Finally before leaving Davy jones tells salazar that the island name contains only the 26 lower case english alphabets and the special character '/'
which could be considered as the 27th character. He wishes him luck and departs. Could you help salazar exact revenge ?
