Hello participant,
Warmest congratulations on your achievement in reaching Round-3!!!

We want our participants to learn something extra on the way of their journey

Here are some information about github:

GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers.Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers. GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public repositories for free, but it charges for private repositories, offering various paid plans. Each public or private repository contains all of a project's files, as well as each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. 

To reach any github repository, you need to follow these simple steps:

1. Enter the github repository's URL in the address bar and then search, you will be on the github repository.
2. Any github URL is of the form: https://github.com/user-name/repository-name (Ex: https://github.com/dummy-iothinc-vitc/ROUND3)
3. So you can reach any github repository by knowing the username of the repository's owner and the name of the repository.
